## About the paper

This paper is an extension to an earlier publication ([Trott & Bergen, 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163853X.2018.1548219)), which found:  
1. Comprehenders are more likely to interpret a potential indirect request (e.g. "It's cold in here") as a request when the speaker can be inferred to be unaware of an obstacle to fulfilling the request (e.g. a broken heater).  
2. Participants with higher *mentalizing* ability, as measured by the Short Story Task ([Dodell-Feder et al, 2013](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11879039/3820595.pdf?sequence=1)), showed a stronger effect of Speaker Awareness. That is, better mentalizers were more likely to modulate their pragmatic interpretations as a function of what a speaker could be inferred to know.

Previous work left a critical question open: is the effect of mentalizing due primarily to better mentalizers being more likely to **sample** information about a speaker's knowledge states in the first place, or are better mentalizers also more likely to **deploy** this information?

In the current work, we manipulate both the task participants are asked to perform (Experiments 1a-1b), as well as how explicitly a speaker's knowledge states are given in a passage (Experiment 2), and find that mentalizing predicts both *sampling* and *deployment* rate, provided the task explicitly involves knowledge in some way. This suggests that comprehenders might recruit their mentalizing capacity flexibly, in a task-dependent manner.

## Data

The aggregated critical data is found under `Experiment1/data` and `Experiment2/data` respectively.

Note that this data does not include identifying information about a participant's gender or age. Please contact Sean Trott (sttrott at ucsd dot edu) separately for demographic information.

### Critical variables


**Condition**: Speaker Unaware, Speaker Aware
